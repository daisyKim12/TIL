# Binary Tree

## What is a tree data structure
Unlike Stack, Queue tree is a nonlinear data structure. It has a hierarchical relationship between elements. 

## Terminology in Tree data structure
- Node: Element populating a tree
- Edge: Connection between nodes. Two node exclusively make a single edge.
- Root node: The top node of the hierarchy, it does not have a parent node.
- Lead node: Node on the bottom of the hierarchy, they do not have a child.

## Types of Tree data structure
- Binary tree
- AVL tree
- RB(Red-Black) tree
- MST(M-way Search Tree)
- B tree
- B + tree
- B * tree
- Trie

## What is Binary tree
Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
